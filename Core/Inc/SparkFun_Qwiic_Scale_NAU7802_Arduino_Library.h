  This library was ported to STM32 by Mike Prior-Jones, February 2022.

  The original SparkFun copyright declaration and information is below.

  This is an Arduino library written for the NAU7802 24-bit wheatstone
  bridge and load cell amplifier.
  By Nathan Seidle @ SparkFun Electronics, March 3nd, 2019

  The NAU7802 is an I2C device that converts analog signals to a 24-bit
  digital signal. This makes it possible to create your own digital scale
  either by hacking an off-the-shelf bathroom scale or by creating your
  own scale using a load cell.

  The NAU7802 is a better version of the popular HX711 load cell amplifier.
  It uses a true I2C interface so that it can share the bus with other
  I2C devices while still taking very accurate 24-bit load cell measurements
  up to 320Hz.
